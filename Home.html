            <br><br><br>
            <p class="par">A waste management system is the strategy an organization uses to dispose, reduce, reuse, and prevent waste. <br><br><br>Possible waste disposal methods are recycling, composting, incineration, landfills, bioremediation, waste to energy, and
                waste minimization.
                <br><br><br>Reducing waste will not only protect the environment but will also save on costs or reduce expenses for disposal.
                <br><br> <br>In the same way, recycling and/or reusing the waste that is produced benefits the environment by lessening the need to extract resources and lowers the potential for contamination.
                <br><br> <br>Waste management is intended to reduce adverse effects of waste on human health, the environment, planetary resources and aesthetics.
                <br><br> <br>The aim of waste management is to reduce the dangerous effects of such waste on the environment and human health.
                <br><br><br>Proper management of waste is important for building sustainable and liveable cities.It reduces the effect of waste on the environment, health, and so on.
                <br><br><br>Improper handling of waste may lead to:
                <br> Threats to human health;
                <br> Harm or kill animals;
                <br>Spread of diseases;
                <br>Damage plants and natural resources
                <br>and many more.
